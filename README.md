# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 1️⃣ Distribution Analysis

* `VV` and `VH` show negatively skewed dB distributions.
* `smap_am` is right-skewed.
* `soil_moisture` mostly lies within **0–1 range**.

Outliers (>1) were removed as physically unrealistic.

## 2️⃣ Correlation Analysis

Correlation with `soil_moisture`:

| Feature | Correlation |
| ------- | ----------- |
| VH      | -0.070      |
| VV      | -0.044      |
| smap_am | 0.041       |

📌 **Observation:**
Very weak linear correlation → Linear models are not sufficient.

This justified using:

* Tree-based models
* Non-linear models
* Feature engineering

---

# ⚙️ Feature Engineering

To capture non-linear relationships:

### 1️⃣ dB → Linear Conversion

```
VV_lin = 10^(VV/10)
VH_lin = 10^(VH/10)
```

### 2️⃣ Interaction Features

* VV × VH
* VV × smap
* VH × smap

### 3️⃣ Ratio Features

* VV / VH
* VH / VV
* VV − VH

### 4️⃣ Polynomial Features

* VV²
* VH²
* smap²

### 5️⃣ Log Transform

* log(1 + smap)

## Selected Final Features

```

VH_lin
smap_am

# 📊 Training Curve Analysis

From the training plot:

- Training and validation loss converge.
- No severe overfitting due to Early Stopping.
- Training loss drops quickly in early epochs.
- Validation loss stabilizes early.
- No major divergence between training and validation curves.

## Interpretation

- The model is not overfitting.
- However, the model is unable to extract stronger predictive signal from the available features.
